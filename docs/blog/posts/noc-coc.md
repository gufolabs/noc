# Keeping It Simple: Our Code of Conduct

For as long as NOC has existed, our community has followed a simple principle: respect.
We’ve never needed pages of regulations to guide us — but it is a good time to put the principle
into words.

Here is our Code of Conduct:

**The Rule**

> *“And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.”*
> 
> -- Luke 6:31

**The Note**

This principle is not unique to any single tradition. Versions of it can be found across cultures,
including Confucius in China and the Hadith in Islam. Its universality shows why it continues
to guide communities everywhere, including ours.

That’s all.

We worked hard to keep it simple. Respect, clarity, and collaboration are what matter most -
and they’ve carried the NOC community from the beginning.
